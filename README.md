# Movies Analysis

## The purpose of this analysis was to work through the ETL process with 2 csv files and a JSON. We created code and then refactored the code to create one function that takes in all three files, cleans and organizes the files, and then loads them to a SQL database. 

## Project Overview:
1. Create and organize an ETL process from raw data to a SQL database.
2. Clean and organize JSON data to be merged with a csv
3. Use sqlalchemy to upload data to pgAdmin

## Resources
- Source of data: 
- Software: Python 3.7.10, Conda 4.10.3, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, Visual Studio Code 1.60.2
- Please see the [here]() to see the refactored code.
- You can also see the preliminary code [here]()

## Results 
### The analysis
- What are two conclusions you can draw?

- What can you conclude?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
